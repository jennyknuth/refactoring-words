# Refactoring Words

Consider the meaning of each sentence. 

How can we say each in fewer words? 

Refactor each sentance to be more consise, less confusing, or better formatted.

### Example:

```
The cat is purple. The cat is purple and being silly.
```

The purple cat is being silly.

### Exercise:

```

```

```

```

```
A teenage boy will smoke his first marijuana cigarette, and within an hour he will laugh at the twisted thought of a horse riding a jockey.
